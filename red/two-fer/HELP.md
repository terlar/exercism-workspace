# Help

## Running the tests

To test the solution, you just **run the test script** from Red Console (e.g. `do %exercism/red/hello-world/hello-world-test.red`) or from commandline (e.g. `red exercism/red/hello-world/hello-world-test.red`).

## Submitting your solution

You can submit your solution using the `exercism submit two-fer.red` command.
This command will upload your solution to the Exercism website and print the solution page's URL.

It's possible to submit an incomplete solution which allows you to:

- See how others have completed the exercise
- Request help from a mentor

## Need to get help?

If you'd like help solving the exercise, check the following pages:

- The [Red track's documentation](https://exercism.org/docs/tracks/red)
- [Exercism's programming category on the forum](https://forum.exercism.org/c/programming/5)
- The [Frequently Asked Questions](https://exercism.org/docs/using/faqs)

Should those resources not suffice, you could submit your (incomplete) solution to request mentoring.

Red has a built-in help system, which is available in Red's console. Every built-in function is documented there. Just enter `help` and follow instructions.

Red's [official documentation](https://github.com/red/docs/blob/master/en/SUMMARY.adoc) is a work in progress, so it probably will be needed to be supplemented with some other materials.

* Lots of functions are described on [Red By Example](https://www.red-by-example.org/) page.
* Also, very extensive, although unofficial [Red Language Specification](https://github.com/meijeru/red.specs-public/blob/master/specs.adoc) is available.
* The best place to get fast help is [Red's Gitter Help channel](https://gitter.im/red/help), where you can chat with friendly community.

# Hello World

The classical introductory exercise. Just say "Hello, World!".

["Hello, World!"](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%22Hello,_world!%22_program) is
the traditional first program for beginning programming in a new language
or environment.

The objectives are simple:

- Write a function that returns the string "Hello, World!".
- Run the test suite and make sure that it succeeds.
- Submit your solution and check it at the website.

If everything goes well, you will be ready to fetch your first real exercise.

## Getting Started

For installation and learning resources, refer to the
[exercism help page](http://exercism.io/languages/coq).

## Checking the solution (testing everything)

To see if your solution works you just need to compile every file.

```bash
coqc *.v
```

There is no additional testing step needed as we can offload all testing to the type checker!
